## Business Task

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

Danny has provided you 3 different datasets for this case study:

#### Table 1: sales 

| column        | type       |    
| ------------- | ---------- |
| customer_id   | VARCHAR(l) |
| order_date    | DATE       |
| product_id    | INTEGER    |

#### Table 2: menu 

| column       | type       |    
| ------------ | ---------- |
| product_id   | INTEGER    |
| product_name | VARCHAR(5) |
| price        | INTEGER    |

#### Table 3: members 

| column        | type       |    
| ------------- | ---------- |
| customer_id   | VARCHAR(l) |
| join_date     | TIMESTAMP  |

FROM menu m
INNER JOIN sales s
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
```

#### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?


#### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
