## Business Task

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea and decides to expand his new Pizza Empire; he does so by launching Pizza Runner.

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

### üßπ Data Cleaning and Transformation

Danny recommends to investigate the data before starting writing SQL queries, since the null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables need to be cleaned. 

### ‚õèÔ∏è Table: customer_orders

By looking at the customer_orders table we notice:

‚Ä¢ there are null values as well as empty cells in the ``exclusions`` and ``extras`` columns

Let's go ahead and create a temporary tables called "```#customer_orders```" by removing null values with empty cells. Remember to use this table during the analysis and not the original customer_orders table 

```sql
SELECT 
    order_id,customer_id,pizza_id,
    CASE 
      WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ''
      ELSE exclusions
      END AS exclusions,
    CASE
      WHEN extras IS NULL OR extras LIKE 'null' THEN ''
      ELSE extras 
      END AS extras,
    order_time
INTO #customer_orders -- #this will be our table of reference throghout the analysis 
FROM customer_orders;
```

This is how our final ```#customer_orders``` table looks like

### ‚õèÔ∏è Table: runner_orders

By looking at the runner_orders table we notice:

‚Ä¢ there are null values in the ``pickup_time``, ``distance``, ``duration`` and ``cancellation`` columns

‚Ä¢ there is "km" in some of the values in the ``distance`` colummn

‚Ä¢ there is "minutes" and "mins" in some of the values in the ``duration`` column

‚Ä¢ there are empty cells in the ``cancellation`` column

Let's proceed to substitute null values with empty spaces, removing "km","minutes","mins" in the different cells.

```sql
SELECT order_id, runner_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN ''
    ELSE pickup_time
    END AS pickup_time,
  CASE 
    WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN ''
    WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM( 'km' FROM distance)
    ELSE distance 
    END AS distance,
  CASE 
    WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN ''
    WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' from duration)
    WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' from duration)
    WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM( 'minutes' FROM duration)
    ELSE duration
    END AS duration,
  CASE 
    WHEN cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation LIKE 'null' THEN ''
    ELSE cancellation
    END AS cancellation
INTO #runner_orders-- #this will be our table of reference throghout the analysis
FROM runner_orders;
```

This is how our final ```#runner_orders``` table looks like
