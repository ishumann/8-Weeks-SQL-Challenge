## Business Task

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea and decides to expand his new Pizza Empire; he does so by launching Pizza Runner.

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

### üßπ Data Cleaning and Transformation

Danny recommends to investigate the data before starting writing SQL queries, since the null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables need to be cleaned. 

### ‚õèÔ∏è Table: customer_orders

By looking at the customer_orders table we notice:

‚Ä¢ there are null values as well as empty cells in the ``exclusions`` and ``extras`` columns

Let's go ahead and create a temporary tables called "```#customer_orders```" by removing null values with empty cells. Remember to use this table during the analysis and not the original customer_orders table 

```sql
SELECT 
    order_id,customer_id,pizza_id,
    CASE 
      WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ''
      ELSE exclusions
      END AS exclusions,
    CASE
      WHEN extras IS NULL OR extras LIKE 'null' THEN ''
      ELSE extras 
      END AS extras,
    order_time
INTO #customer_orders -- #this will be our table of reference throghout the analysis 
FROM customer_orders;
```

This is how our final ```#customer_orders``` table looks like

### ‚õèÔ∏è Table: runner_orders

By looking at the runner_orders table we notice:

‚Ä¢ there are null values in the ``pickup_time``, ``distance``, ``duration`` and ``cancellation`` columns

‚Ä¢ there is "km" in some of the values in the ``distance`` colummn

‚Ä¢ there is "minutes" and "mins" in some of the values in the ``duration`` column

‚Ä¢ there are empty cells in the ``cancellation`` column

Let's proceed to substitute null values with empty spaces, removing "km","minutes","mins" in the different cells.

```sql
SELECT order_id, runner_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN ''
    ELSE pickup_time
    END AS pickup_time,
  CASE 
    WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN ''
    WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM( 'km' FROM distance)
    ELSE distance 
    END AS distance,
  CASE 
    WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN ''
    WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' from duration)
    WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' from duration)
    WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM( 'minutes' FROM duration)
    ELSE duration
    END AS duration,
  CASE 
    WHEN cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation LIKE 'null' THEN ''
    ELSE cancellation
    END AS cancellation
INTO #runner_orders-- #this will be our table of reference throghout the analysis
FROM runner_orders;
```

This is how our final ```#runner_orders``` table looks like

Now that our tables are cleaned and ready to use, we can start working to the different questions!

### üìå Case Study Questions: 

#### A: Pizza Metrics

1. How many pizzas were ordered?
2. How many unique customer orders were made?
3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

#### B: Runner and Customer Experience

1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

#### C: Ingredient Optimisation

1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
2. What was the most commonly added extra?
3. What was the most common exclusion?
4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
Meat Lovers
Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers
5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"
6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

#### D: Pricing and Ratings

1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
Add cheese is $1 extra
3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
customer_id
order_id
runner_id
rating
order_time
pickup_time
Time between order and pickup
Delivery duration
Average speed
Total number of pizzas
5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
